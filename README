# üß† Wavefunction Approximation using Machine Learning

This project explores how machine learning, particularly neural networks built with Keras, can approximate quantum mechanical wavefunctions by learning the solutions to the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation.

---

## üß™ Problem Statement

In quantum mechanics, the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation describes the energy states of a particle in a potential field:

\[
\hat{H} \psi(x) = E \psi(x)
\]

where:

- \( \hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x) \) is the Hamiltonian operator  
- \( \psi(x) \) is the wavefunction  
- \( V(x) \) is the potential energy  
- \( E \) is the energy eigenvalue  

The goal is to approximate \( \psi(x) \) using neural networks under various quantum potentials (e.g., harmonic oscillator, square well).

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Approximate ground-state wavefunctions \( \psi(x) \) using supervised learning.
- Incorporate physical laws using **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**.
- Estimate the ground state energy \( E \) through **Variational Monte Carlo (VMC)**.

## üß† Techniques Used

### ‚úÖ Supervised Learning
Train a Keras-based MLP to match analytical \( \psi(x) \) from known systems (e.g., harmonic oscillator).

### ‚úÖ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
Define a custom loss function that penalizes deviations from the Schr√∂dinger equation:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{PINN}} = \left\| \hat{H} \psi(x) - E \psi(x) \right\|^2
\]

This forces the model to obey physical constraints during training.

### ‚úÖ Variational Monte Carlo (VMC)
Use neural networks (e.g., dense or RBM) as variational wavefunctions, then optimize expected energy:

\[
E[\psi] = \frac{\langle \psi | \hat{H} | \psi \rangle}{\langle \psi | \psi \rangle}
\]

using stochastic sampling.
